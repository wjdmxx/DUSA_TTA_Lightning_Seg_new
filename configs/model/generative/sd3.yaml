model_path: "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium-diffusers"

# Sliding window configuration
# Window slides along the long edge of the image
# Short edge is scaled to 512, so window_size=512 covers the short edge exactly
sliding_window:
  window_size: 512
  stride: 171  # ~1/3 overlap for smooth coverage

# Timestep range for flow matching [min, max]
# Using fixed timestep 0.25 (as in original code)
timestep_range: [0.25, 0.25]

# Top-k class selection
topk: 1
temperature: 1.0
classes_threshold: 20  # Max classes to process per forward pass

# Prompt template for class embeddings
prompt: "a photo of a {}"
class_names: "ADE_CATEGORIES"

# Preprocessing
preprocessor:
  input_size: [512, 512]
  normalize: true  # Normalize to [-1, 1] for VAE
